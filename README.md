# 42 - Pipex

## About
Pipex is a project from the 42 School curriculum designed to introduce students to Unix pipes and process management. The goal is to create a program that mimics the behavior of shell pipelines, allowing the output of one command to be used as the input for another.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
